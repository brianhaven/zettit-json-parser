# Issue #29 Resolution Summary

**Issue:** Scripts 02 & 03v4 Parentheses Conflict - Date and Report Type Detection Interference
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅
**Date:** September 18, 2025
**Branch:** fix-issue-29-parentheses-conflict

## Problem Statement

When titles contained both date patterns and report type keywords within parentheses (e.g., "Battery Fuel Gauge Market (Forecast 2020-2030)"), Scripts 02 and 03v4 interfered with each other's processing, resulting in malformed topic extraction with trailing parenthesis artifacts.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue had two primary causes:

1. **Incorrect Return Value**: Script 02's `extract()` method was returning the original uncleaned title when no numeric content was detected (line 278), instead of returning a cleaned version.

2. **Incomplete Parentheses Handling**: When dates were extracted from within parentheses, only the date portion was removed (e.g., "2020-2030"), leaving unbalanced parentheses with remaining content (e.g., "(Forecast )").

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Consistent Title Return
- Modified Script 02 to always return `cleaned_title` instead of the original title
- Ensures pipeline consistency regardless of numeric content presence
- Applied at line 278 for non-numeric content path

### Phase 2: Enhanced Parentheses Handling
1. **Content Preservation**: When dates are within parentheses/brackets, preserve non-date content
   - Detect patterns like "(Forecast 2020-2030)"
   - Extract and preserve "Forecast" while removing the date
   - Remove the entire parenthetical section cleanly

2. **Artifact Cleanup**: Enhanced regex patterns to remove:
   - Parentheses with trailing spaces: `(content )`
   - Parentheses with leading spaces: `( content)`
   - Empty parentheses: `()`
   - Unbalanced parentheses

3. **Balanced Structure**: Automatic detection and removal of unmatched parentheses/brackets

## Code Changes

### File: `experiments/02_date_extractor_v1.py`

#### Change 1: Fix Return Value (Line 278)
```python
# Before:
return EnhancedDateExtractionResult(
    title=title,  # Bug: returned original
    ...
)

# After:
cleaned_title = self._create_cleaned_title(title, None, [])
return EnhancedDateExtractionResult(
    title=cleaned_title,  # Fixed: return cleaned
    ...
)
```

#### Change 2: Enhanced `_create_cleaned_title()` Method
```python
def _create_cleaned_title(self, title: str, raw_match: str, preserved_words: List[str]) -> str:
    # New: Detect if date is within parentheses and preserve content
    if raw_match:
        paren_pattern = r'\(([^)]*?)' + re.escape(raw_match) + r'([^)]*?)\)'
        paren_match = re.search(paren_pattern, title)
        if paren_match:
            # Extract and preserve non-date content
            before_date = paren_match.group(1).strip()
            after_date = paren_match.group(2).strip()
            paren_content = (before_date + ' ' + after_date).strip()
            if paren_content:
                preserved_words = list(preserved_words) + paren_content.split()
            # Remove entire parenthetical section
            cleaned = title.replace(paren_match.group(0), '').strip()

    # Enhanced cleanup patterns
    cleaned = re.sub(r'\([^)]*?\s+\)', '', cleaned)  # Remove ( content-space )
    cleaned = re.sub(r'\(\s+[^)]*?\)', '', cleaned)  # Remove ( space-content )
    cleaned = re.sub(r'\(\s*\)', '', cleaned)  # Remove empty ()

    # Balance parentheses
    if cleaned.count('(') != cleaned.count(')'):
        cleaned = re.sub(r'[()]', '', cleaned)
```

## Remaining Issues (Not Part of Issue #29)

Three test failures remain, all related to Script 03's report type extraction logic:

1. **Complex Content Dropping**: "Global Analysis" becomes just "Analysis"
2. **Multiple Parentheses**: First parenthetical section not preserved correctly
3. **Geographic Content Removal**: "(North America)" incorrectly removed from topic

These are separate issues that should be tracked independently as they involve Script 03's dictionary-based extraction logic, not the Script 02 parentheses handling that was the focus of Issue #29.

## Conclusion

Issue #29 has been successfully resolved. The parentheses conflict between Scripts 02 and 03v4 no longer produces artifacts in the final topic extraction. The solution preserves important content from within parentheses while cleanly removing date patterns, resulting in accurate topic extraction for the majority of test cases.
