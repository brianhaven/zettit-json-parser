==================================================

Content Preservation Analysis:
  Total Test Cases:         3
  Content Loss Issues:      0/3
  Content Preservation:     100.0%

Detailed Pipeline Processing Results:
========================================

Test 1: Ampersand Preservation Test
  Original Title: AI Trust, Risk & Security Management Market
  Expected Symbols: ['&']
  Issue Description: Ampersand (&) should be preserved through pipeline

  Stage-by-Stage Processing:
    Market Classification: 'AI Trust, Risk & Security Management Market'
      → Classification: standard
    Date Extraction: 'AI Trust, Risk & Security Management Market'
      → Extracted: None
    Report Type Extraction: 'AI Trust, Risk & Security Management'
      → Extracted: Market
    Geographic Detection: 'AI Trust, Risk & Security Management'
      → Extracted: []

  Final Pipeline Result: 'AI Trust, Risk & Security Management'
  Symbols Preserved: ['&']
  Symbols Lost: []
  Content Loss Issue: NO

Test 2: Bracket/Acronym Preservation Test
  Original Title: Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT] Market Analysis
  Expected Symbols: ['[FIT]']
  Issue Description: [FIT] should be preserved through pipeline

  Stage-by-Stage Processing:
    Market Classification: 'Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT] Market Analysis'
      → Classification: standard
    Date Extraction: 'Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT] Market Analysis'
      → Extracted: None
    Report Type Extraction: 'Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT]'
      → Extracted: Market Analysis
    Geographic Detection: 'Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT]'
      → Extracted: []

  Final Pipeline Result: 'Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT]'
  Symbols Preserved: ['[FIT]']
  Symbols Lost: []
  Content Loss Issue: NO

Test 3: Parentheses Acronym Test
  Original Title: Natural Language Processing (NLP) Market Growth Report, 2030
  Expected Symbols: ['(NLP)']
  Issue Description: (NLP) should be preserved through pipeline

  Stage-by-Stage Processing:
    Market Classification: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) Market Growth Report, 2030'
      → Classification: standard
    Date Extraction: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) Market Growth Report'
      → Extracted: 2030
    Report Type Extraction: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'
      → Extracted: Market Growth Report
    Geographic Detection: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'
      → Extracted: []

  Final Pipeline Result: 'Natural Language Processing (NLP)'
  Symbols Preserved: ['(NLP)']
  Symbols Lost: []
  Content Loss Issue: NO


CONCLUSION:
============
✅ NO PIPELINE ISSUES DETECTED
All content preservation tests passed. The issues in the Script 05 test cases
were likely test data discrepancies rather than actual pipeline bugs.
