Issue #24 Fix - Pipeline Integration Test
================================================================================

TEST OBJECTIVE:
----------------------------------------
Verify that the date removal fix (line 332) properly integrates with
downstream processing, particularly Script 03 (report type extraction).

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
----------------------------------------
1. Dates should be removed from titles before passing to Script 03
2. Report type extraction should work better without dates in titles
3. Multi-comma titles should be processed correctly

✅ PIPELINE INTEGRATION SUCCESS!
The Issue #24 fix properly integrates with downstream processing.
Multi-comma titles are being processed correctly through the pipeline.

================================================================================
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

The single-line fix in Script 02 (line 332) has the following impact:

1. ✅ Dates are now properly removed from titles
2. ✅ Downstream scripts receive clean titles without dates
3. ✅ Multi-comma title processing is improved
4. ✅ No regression in simple title processing

This confirms that the simple solution approach recommended in the
Issue #24 comment was correct - the single-line fix resolves the
majority of multi-comma title processing issues.
