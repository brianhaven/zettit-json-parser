## Test Summary

**SUCCESS: Market-Aware Workflow Bug Fixed**

- **Total Titles Processed:** 25
- **Successful Extractions:** 25/25 (100.0%)
- **Market-Aware Processing:** 2 titles (8.0%)
- **Standard Processing:** 23 titles (92.0%)
- **Average Confidence:** 0.948
- **Confidence Range:** 0.300 - 1.000
- **Failed Extractions:** 0

## Root Cause Fix Applied

**Issue:** `ReportTypeFormat.UNKNOWN` enum value doesn't exist in the ReportTypeFormat enum, causing `AttributeError: UNKNOWN` exception in market-aware workflow processing.

**Fix:** Changed line 915 in `03_report_type_extractor_v3.py` from:
```python
'format_type': result.get('format_type', ReportTypeFormat.UNKNOWN),
```
to:
```python
'format_type': result.get('format_type', ReportTypeFormat.COMPOUND),
```

**Impact:** Market-aware workflow now returns correct results instead of empty strings due to exception handling.
