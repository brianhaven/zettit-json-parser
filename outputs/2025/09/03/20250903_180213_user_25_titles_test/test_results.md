## Key Validations

### ✅ Connector Preservation
- **"for" connector:** All 20 "market_for" titles correctly preserve the "for" connector in pipeline forward text
- **"in" connector:** All 5 "market_in" titles correctly preserve the "in" connector in pipeline forward text

### ✅ Special Character Handling
- **Ampersand (&):** "Oil & Gas" correctly preserved in title #11
- **Ampersand (&):** "Middle East & North Africa" correctly preserved in title #25
- **Comma handling:** "Physical Therapy, Examination, and Operating" truncated appropriately to "Physical Therapy"

### ✅ Complex Title Processing
- **Long titles:** Title #9 with 73 characters processed successfully
- **Multiple keywords:** "Trends & Analysis FCSC Outlook" extracted as "Market Trends Analysis Outlook"
- **Industry terms:** "Industry Growth" and "Industry Anaalysis" handled correctly

### ⚠️ Original Spelling Preserved
The following typos from original titles were preserved as-is:
- Title #13: "Industy" (missing 'r')
- Title #19: "Repot" (should be "Report")
- Title #23: "Anaalysis" (extra 'a')

## Technical Notes

### Market-Aware Workflow Performance
- All 25 titles required market-aware processing (none were "standard")
- Market term extraction working correctly for both "Market for" and "Market in" patterns
- Report type reconstruction successfully combining "Market" with extracted keywords

### Pipeline Forward Text Quality
- Clean extraction of topics without market terms or report types
- Proper truncation at first comma for complex titles (e.g., title #17)
- Connector words ("for", "in") preserved for context

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Duplicate title:** Title #17 and #20 are identical - both processed consistently
2. **Regional prefixes:** "EMEA" and "Middle East & North Africa" preserved as part of topic
3. **Acronyms:** "EVs", "UVC", "FCSC", "DG" all preserved correctly
4. **Complex applications:** Long descriptive phrases like "Environmental Detection and Remediation" handled properly
