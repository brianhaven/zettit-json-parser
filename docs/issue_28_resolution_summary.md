# GitHub Issue #28 Resolution Summary

**Issue Title:** Script 01 Market Term Classification Failure: 'Market in' Context Integration Issue

**Resolution Date:** September 23, 2025

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Description

Script 01 correctly identified `market_in` classification but the pipeline failed to properly integrate geographic context during processing, resulting in orphaned prepositions in the final topic extraction.

### Example Failure Case
- **Original Title:** "Retail Market in Singapore - Size, Outlook & Statistics"
- **Problem:** Topic extracted as "Retail in" (orphaned preposition)
- **Expected:** Topic should be "Retail" (clean)

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred in Script 04 (Geographic Entity Detector) where geographic entities like "Singapore" were correctly removed from text, but the associated prepositions ("in", "for", "by", etc.) were left orphaned in the remaining text.

### Processing Flow Before Fix
1. Input: "Retail in Singapore"
2. Geographic extraction: Removes "Singapore"
3. Result: "Retail in" ❌ (orphaned "in")

## Solution Implemented

Modified the `cleanup_remaining_text()` method in `04_geographic_entity_detector_v2.py` to remove orphaned prepositions after geographic entity extraction.

### Code Changes

```python
def cleanup_remaining_text(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Final cleanup of remaining text after geographic extraction."""
    if not text:
        return ""

    # Remove dangling connectors and artifacts
    text = re.sub(r'^\s*(and|&|,|;|-)\s*', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    text = re.sub(r'\s*(and|&|,|;|-)\s*$', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

    # Issue #28 Fix: Remove orphaned prepositions after geographic removal
    # Handles "Retail in" → "Retail" after removing "Singapore" from "Retail in Singapore"
    text = re.sub(r'\s+(in|for|by|of|at|to|with|from)\s*$', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

    # Also handle orphaned prepositions at start
    # Handles "in Technology" → "Technology"
    text = re.sub(r'^(in|for|by|of|at|to|with|from)\s+', '', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

    # Clean up multiple spaces and normalize
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)

    # Remove single character artifacts
    words = text.split()
    cleaned_words = [word for word in words if len(word.strip('.,;:-()[]{}')) > 1]

    return ' '.join(cleaned_words).strip()
```

## Test Results

### Full Pipeline Integration Test
- **Total Tests:** 7
- **Passed:** 6
- **Success Rate:** 85.7%

### Key Test Cases
✅ **Main Issue Case RESOLVED:**
- Input: "Retail Market in Singapore - Size, Outlook & Statistics"
- Output Topic: "Retail" (correct)

✅ **Other Successful Cases:**
- "Technology Market in Asia Pacific, 2025-2030" → "Technology"
- "Healthcare Market for Europe Analysis, 2024-2029" → "Healthcare"
- "Software Solutions Market of United States Report, 2025" → "Software Solutions"
- "AI Market in Automotive" → "AI in Automotive" (preserves industry context)

### Edge Case
❌ One test case requires further consideration:
- "Global Automotive Components Market by Region" → "Automotive Components by Region"
- Note: "Region" is not a geographic entity but a meta-descriptor, representing a different pattern

## Benefits of This Solution

1. **Directly Addresses Root Cause:** Targets orphaned prepositions specifically
2. **Minimal Risk:** Single method modification, no pipeline architecture changes
3. **Broad Application:** Handles orphaned prepositions from ANY source pattern
4. **Consistent Philosophy:** Maintains simple solution approach
5. **Low Maintenance:** Self-contained fix requiring no coordination between scripts

## Impact on Pipeline

- **Processing Success:** Pipeline remains fully operational
- **Data Quality:** Significant improvement in topic extraction accuracy
- **Accuracy:** 85.7% test success rate, with main issue case fully resolved
- **Performance:** No performance impact, simple regex operations

## Files Modified

1. `/experiments/04_geographic_entity_detector_v2.py` - Added orphaned preposition cleanup
2. `/experiments/tests/test_issue_28_fix.py` - Unit test for the fix
3. `/experiments/tests/test_issue_28_pipeline_integration.py` - Full pipeline integration test

## Validation Outputs

Test results saved to:
- `/outputs/2025/09/23/20250923_125538_test_issue_28_fix/`
- `/outputs/2025/09/23/20250923_125757_issue_28_pipeline_test/`

## Recommendation

The fix successfully resolves the primary issue described in GitHub Issue #28. The orphaned preposition cleanup ensures that when geographic entities are removed from text, any associated prepositions are also cleaned up, resulting in clean and predictable topic extraction.

The one edge case ("by Region") represents a different pattern where "Region" is not a geographic entity but a categorization descriptor. This could be addressed in a future enhancement if needed, but does not invalidate the current fix.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Merge the fix branch to master
2. ✅ Close GitHub Issue #28 as resolved
3. Consider future enhancement for meta-descriptors like "by Region" if business requirements dictate
