## Attribute Standardization Evidence

### Successfully Standardized Attributes
```python
# All 150 test cases successfully accessed:
result['confidence_scores']['geographic_extraction']  # ✅ Was confidence_score
result['processing_notes']['geographic_notes']        # ✅ Was processing_notes
result['extracted_regions']                          # ✅ Unchanged (preserved)
```

### Geographic Extraction Quality Examples

1. **"Latin America Drilling Fluids Waste Management Market"**
   - Regions: ['Central and South America']
   - Confidence: 0.850
   - Notes: "Pattern 'Central and South America': 1 matches"
   - Final Topic: "Drilling Fluids Waste Management"

2. **"U.S. Sterilization Services Market Size, Industry Report, 2030"**
   - Regions: ['United States']
   - Confidence: 0.850
   - Notes: "Pattern 'United States': 1 matches"
   - Final Topic: "Sterilization Services"

3. **"Germany Kitchenware Market Size, Industry Report, 2033"**
   - Regions: ['Germany']
