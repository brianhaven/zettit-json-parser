# Pull Request: Fix Date Artifact Cleanup (Issue #23)

## Summary
Implements a simple 5-line regex enhancement to Script 05's `_apply_systematic_removal()` method to clean up date removal artifacts in extracted topics.

## Changes
- **Modified:** `experiments/05_topic_extractor_v1.py` - Added artifact cleanup after systematic removal
- **Added:** 3 test scripts validating the fix with 77 total test cases
- **Added:** Comprehensive documentation of implementation and validation

## Test Results
âœ… **100% Success Rate:**
- Unit tests: 10/10 edge cases pass
- Integration tests: 15/15 real titles clean
- MongoDB tests: 52/52 production titles without artifacts

## Edge Cases Resolved
- Empty parentheses `()` and brackets `[]` after date removal
- Double spaces from removal operations
- Orphaned connectors: "Forecast to", "to", "through", "till", "until"

## Implementation Details
The fix adds targeted regex patterns after the existing systematic removal process:
1. Removes empty containers left by date extraction
2. Cleans orphaned date connectors at end of text
3. Re-normalizes spacing after cleanup

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk:** Changes only affect final cleanup stage
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality preserved
- **Backward Compatible:** No API or interface changes
