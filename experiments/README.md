## Test Scripts Directory (`tests/`)

Development and validation scripts moved to maintain clean organization:
- `spacy_optimization_v1.py` - spaCy model performance testing and optimization
- `description_analysis_v1.py` - Description field analysis for HTML vs text processing
- `aggregated_test_v1.py` - Text aggregation strategy testing (individual docs outperform)
- `html_analysis_v1.py` - HTML vs plain text comparison (HTML prevents concatenation)
- `dual_model_pattern_discovery_v1.py` - Original dual-model testing (31% improvement proven)
- `add_discovered_patterns_v1.py` - Pattern addition utilities for library management
- `test_date_extractor_v1.py` - Comprehensive date extraction validation
- `test_market_classifier_v1.py` - Market term classification validation
- `test_geographic_detector_v1.py` - Geographic detection accuracy testing
- `test_pattern_manager_v1.py` - Pattern library manager validation

## Component Integration Information

**CRITICAL:** Before creating test scripts or integrating components, reference the updated documentation:
- **Main Documentation:** `../CLAUDE.md` (with @ references to modular docs)
- **Integration Guide:** `../documentation/claude-component-integration.md`
- **Pre-Development Analysis:** `../documentation/claude-pre-development-analysis.md`

### Current Verified Component Details (2025-08-27):

| Script | Class Name | Initialization | Main Method |
|--------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 01 | `MarketTermClassifier` | `(pattern_library_manager=None)` | `classify(title)` |
| 02 | `EnhancedDateExtractor` | `(pattern_library_manager)` REQUIRED | `extract(title)` |
| 03 v4 | `PureDictionaryReportTypeExtractor` | `(pattern_library_manager)` REQUIRED | `extract(title)` |
| 04 v2 | `GeographicEntityDetector` | `(patterns_collection)` RAW | `extract_geographic_entities(text)` |
| 05 | `TopicExtractor` | `(pattern_library_manager)` | `extract(title)` |

**Important Notes:**
- Scripts 01-03 v4 use `PatternLibraryManager` (dictionary architecture)
- Script 04+ uses raw MongoDB collections (lean architecture)
- All result objects use `.title` for cleaned text (NOT `.remaining_text`)
- PatternLibraryManager requires connection string: `PatternLibraryManager(os.getenv('MONGODB_URI'))`

## Processing Philosophy

**Enhanced Systematic Removal Approach:**
1. **Remove known patterns in priority order** (dates, report types, regions)
2. **What remains IS the topic** (regardless of internal punctuation) 
3. **Track performance metrics** in MongoDB for continuous improvement
4. **Use MongoDB pattern libraries** for real-time updates without deployment
5. **HTML-aware processing** prevents concatenation artifacts in geographic detection
6. **Dual-model validation** provides enhanced pattern discovery and confidence scoring
7. **Human review workflow** enables continuous pattern library enhancement

## Organized Output Directory Manager

**ALL scripts now use the standardized organized output directory manager (`00c_output_directory_manager_v1.py`):**

### Output Structure
- **Organized Hierarchy:** `outputs/YYYY/MM/DD/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_script_name/`
- **Auto-Detection:** Automatically detects project root from any script location
- **Legacy Compatibility:** Works from main scripts, test scripts, and utilities

### Integration Pattern
All main scripts (01-07) now include:
```python
# Dynamic import of organized output directory manager
_spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("output_dir_manager", 
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "00c_output_directory_manager_v1.py"))
_output_module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(_spec)
_spec.loader.exec_module(_output_module)
create_organized_output_directory = _output_module.create_organized_output_directory
create_output_file_header = _output_module.create_output_file_header
```

### Usage in Scripts
```python
# Create organized output directory
output_dir = create_organized_output_directory("script_name_demo")

# Create standardized file headers
header = create_output_file_header("script_name", "Description of output")
```

### Output Standards
- **Timestamp Format:** Pacific Time (PDT/PST) in both directory names and headers
- **File Headers:** Dual timestamps (Pacific Time and UTC) with script metadata
- **Directory Structure:** Hierarchical YYYY/MM/DD organization for easy navigation
- **Consistent API:** Same function signatures across all script implementations

### Phase 1 Integration Status ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ **Script 01**: Market classifier with organized demo output
- ✅ **Script 02**: Date extractor with placeholder output functionality  
- ✅ **Script 03 v4**: Production-ready with organized output (already integrated)
- ✅ **Script 04 v2**: Lean approach with organized output (already integrated)
- ✅ **Script 05**: Topic extractor with enhanced organized output
- ✅ **Script 06**: Confidence tracker with comprehensive organized reporting
- ✅ **Script 07**: Pipeline orchestrator with organized output and metadata
- ✅ **Test Harnesses**: Both pipeline test scripts use organized output structure

## Database Integration

- **Primary data:** `markets_raw` collection (19,558+ titles)
- **Pattern libraries:** `pattern_libraries` collection with real-time updates
- **Processed results:** `markets_processed` collection
- **Performance tracking:** Built-in success/failure metrics with confidence scoring

## Key Technical Breakthroughs

### Enhanced Date Extraction with Numeric Pre-filtering
- **Problem:** Titles without dates were incorrectly classified as extraction failures
- **Solution:** Numeric content analysis to distinguish "no dates present" vs "dates missed"
- **Result:** 100% accuracy on titles containing dates, proper categorization of no-date titles

### Market-Aware Processing Logic Implementation
- **Problem:** "Market for X" and "Market in Y" required different processing than standard "Market Z"
- **Solution:** Dual processing workflows - market term extraction/rearrangement vs direct pattern matching
- **Result:** Accurate processing of both classification types with proper pipeline text generation

### Acronym-Embedded Pattern Processing (**ISSUE #11 RESOLVED**)
- **Problem:** Acronyms like "DEW" in "Market Size, DEW Industry Report" were being missed or misclassified
- **Root Cause Discovery:** Missing `ReportTypeFormat.ACRONYM_EMBEDDED` enum value + control flow structure bug
- **Solution:** Added missing enum value, fixed duplicate match blocks, corrected pattern priority order
- **GitHub Issue #11:** **COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - compound patterns no longer match before acronym_embedded
- **Result:** 100% functional acronym extraction with pipeline preservation: "Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)"

### HTML Processing Innovation
- **Problem:** spaCy was concatenating regions like "KoreaIndonesiaAustraliaThailand" 
- **Solution:** BeautifulSoup parsing with proper block-level separators
- **Result:** Clean geographic entity detection from HTML descriptions

### Dual spaCy Model Validation  
- **Finding:** Single model (en_core_web_md) missed many patterns
- **Enhancement:** Added en_core_web_lg for cross-validation
- **Result:** 31% more pattern discoveries with confidence scoring

### Individual vs Aggregated Processing
- **Testing:** Compared bulk text processing vs individual document processing
- **Finding:** Individual document processing outperforms text aggregation
- **Implementation:** Process each description separately for optimal results

### Human Review Workflow
- **Challenge:** Automatic pattern discovery includes noise
- **Solution:** Approval workflow with classification (new terms, aliases, noise)
- **Features:** MongoDB conflict detection and automated library updates

### Database Quality Assurance (Recent Enhancement)
- **Problem:** Malformed patterns in database causing processing failures
- **Discovery:** Found empty compound pattern with missing regex field during Issue #11 investigation
- **Solution:** Automated pattern validation and cleanup, removed malformed entries
- **Result:** Clean database with 100% valid pattern structures for reliable processing
