## Conversation Highlights

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Script 04 v3 Architecture Decision**: Implemented enhanced separator handling as comprehensive extension of v2 approach rather than complete rewrite
2. **Success Rate Target Achievement**: 90% success rate benchmark achieved, representing significant quality improvement
3. **Issue Scope Clarification**: Determined remaining "And" artifacts are Script 03 issue, requiring separate Issue #26 regression handling
4. **Testing Strategy Validation**: Comprehensive pipeline testing confirmed integration success without regressions

### Important Discussions

1. **Performance Metrics Analysis**: 90% success rate represents substantial improvement over 70% v2 baseline
2. **Root Cause Investigation**: Systematic analysis revealed Script 03 vs Script 04 separator handling separation
3. **Integration Validation Strategy**: Pipeline testing approach confirmed cross-script compatibility
4. **Issue Classification Method**: Clear distinction between resolved Issue #33 and pending Issue #26 regression

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Address Issue #26 Regression**: Extend Script 03 v4 `_clean_reconstructed_type()` method to handle word-based separators
2. **Begin Phase 5 Implementation**: Initiate Topic Extractor (Script 05) testing and refinement with Script 03 v4 integration
3. **Create Full Pipeline Tests**: Develop comprehensive 01â†’02â†’03v4â†’04v3â†’05 pipeline testing framework

### Short-term Goals

1. **Validate Issue #26 Fix**: Test enhanced separator handling in Script 03 v4
2. **Script 05 Integration**: Establish Topic Extractor integration with current pipeline
3. **Large-scale Testing**: Process 500-1000 titles through complete 5-script pipeline

### Medium-term Objectives

1. **Phase 5 Completion**: Achieve >92% accuracy in topic extraction
2. **Phase 6 Initiation**: Begin confidence tracking integration across complete pipeline
3. **Production Readiness**: Finalize system for deployment with comprehensive documentation
