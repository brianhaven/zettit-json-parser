# Session Logs Index - Market Research Title Parser

## Project Overview
Systematic pattern-matching solution for extracting structured information from market research report titles using MongoDB-based pattern libraries.

## Session History

### 2025-08-21: Pipeline Components Complete
- **Session File**: [session-2025-08-21-000000.md](./session-2025-08-21-000000.md)
- **Duration**: ~6 hours
- **Focus**: Completing Topic Extraction, Confidence Tracking, and Pipeline Orchestrator
- **Tasks Completed**: 7, 8, 9 (partial)
- **Key Achievement**: All core pipeline components operational, ready for testing phase
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 systematic testing of Market Term Classifier

### 2025-08-21: Phase 1 Market Term Classifier - COMPLETE SUCCESS ✅
- **Session File**: [session-20250821_204337.md](./session-20250821_204337.md)
- **Duration**: ~8 hours
- **Focus**: Phase 1 Market Term Classifier Testing & Production Readiness Achievement
- **Tasks Completed**: Phase 1 complete with 100% accuracy on 2,000 real documents
- **Key Achievement**: Database-driven architecture, removed all hardcoded patterns, production-ready
- **Performance**: 99.80% standard processing, 0.20% special patterns, 0% ambiguous
- **Pattern Discovery**: Found rare "Market In" and "Market For" examples in real data
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 2 Date Extractor pipeline integration (01→02)

### 2025-08-22: Phase 2 Date Extractor - COMPLETE SUCCESS ✅
- **Session File**: [session-20250822_224906.md](./session-20250822_224906.md)
- **Duration**: Full development session
- **Focus**: Phase 2 Date Extractor completion with 100% accuracy achievement
- **Tasks Completed**: Phase 2 complete with 100% accuracy on 4,000 real documents (4 validation runs)
- **Key Achievement**: Revolutionary numeric pre-filtering, pattern library expansion 45→64 patterns
- **Performance**: 100% accuracy, zero gaps, proper "no dates present" vs "dates missed" categorization
- **Technical Innovation**: Enhanced date extractor with comprehensive validation framework
- **Next Steps**: Begin Phase 3 Report Type Extractor pipeline integration (01→02→03)

### 2025-08-26: CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DISCOVERY - Market-Aware Processing Gap ⚠️
- **Session File**: [session-20250826_023622.md](./session-20250826_023622.md)
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Focus**: Discovery of critical architectural gap in Script 03 - Missing market-aware processing logic
- **Critical Issue**: Script 03 completely missing market-aware processing workflow (extraction→rearrangement→reconstruction)
- **Key Discovery**: All titles incorrectly processed through unified database matching instead of differentiated workflows
- **Blocking Impact**: Issues #4, #5, and Phases 4-5 blocked pending GitHub Issue #10 resolution
- **Documentation Enhanced**: Added comprehensive market-aware vs standard processing specifications to CLAUDE.md
- **GitHub Issue Created**: Issue #10 with detailed implementation requirements
- **Next Steps**: URGENT - Implement market-aware processing logic in Script 03 before proceeding

## Statistics
- **Total Sessions**: 4
- **Tasks Completed**: 8/15 (53.3%) with Task 9 in-progress (all subtasks complete)
- **Pipeline Components**: 7/7 (100%) - BUT Script 03 requires architectural redesign
- **Pattern Libraries Built**: 3/4 (Market Term + Date + Geographic complete, Report Type needs market-aware logic)
- **Phase 1 Success**: 100% accuracy achieved on 2,000 real documents
- **Phase 2 Success**: 100% accuracy achieved on 4,000 real documents (4 validation runs)
- **Critical Blocker Identified**: Market-aware processing gap in Script 03

## URGENT Next Session Focus
**PRIORITY 1 - GitHub Issue #10 (CRITICAL BLOCKER):**
1. **Implement market-aware processing logic in Script 03**
   - Add market term extraction methods ("Market for X", "Market in Y")
   - Build title rearrangement workflow (move market terms to end)
   - Implement reconstruction functionality with proper positioning
   - Create dual processing paths (standard vs market-aware)

**PRIORITY 2 - Unblock downstream phases:**
2. Resolve GitHub Issues #4 and #5 (Scripts 04/05 market term compatibility)
3. Resume Phase 4-5 systematic testing with validated pipeline architecture
4. Scale testing to 1000 titles with proper market-aware processing
