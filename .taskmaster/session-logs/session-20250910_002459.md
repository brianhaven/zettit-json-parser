2. **3v3.29** - Resolve Git Issue #24 (Single-line date removal bug fix)
3. **GIT ISSUE #18** - Geographic Pattern Curation: Idaho False Positive & Compound Region Cleanup
4. Phase marker for foundation completion

#### PHASE 2: Integration Issues (4 items)
1. **GIT ISSUE #29** - Scripts 02 & 03v4 Parentheses Conflict: Date and Report Type Detection Interference
2. **3v3.27** - Resolve Git Issue #22 (Minimal attribute standardization)
3. **3v3.28** - Resolve Git Issue #23 (Simple 5-line regex enhancement)
4. Phase marker for integration completion

#### PHASE 3: Complex Issues (3 items)
1. **GIT ISSUE #27** - Script 03 v4: Pre-Market Dictionary Terms Causing Content Loss (HIGH COMPLEXITY)
2. **GIT ISSUE #28** - Script 01 Market Term Classification Failure: 'Market in' Context Integration Issue
3. **GIT ISSUE #19** - Market Term Symbol Preservation: Ampersand (&) Loss During Extraction

#### Additional Work Items (12 items)
- **3v3.30**: Run larger tests to confirm implementation of git issue #22-24 resolution
- **Phase 5**: Topic Extractor (Script 05) Testing & Refinement (8 subtasks)
- **Phase 6**: Integration & Confidence Tracking (6 subtasks)

### Blockers
- **Issue #26**: CRITICAL priority - blocks production readiness until resolved
- **Cross-script coordination**: Issues #29, #27, #28 require careful integration testing

## Technical Context

### Code Changes
- **No code changes made**: Session focused on analysis and strategic planning
- **GitHub Comments**: Comprehensive technical analysis posted to Issues #22, #23, #18

### Configuration Updates
- **Todo List Structure**: Reorganized into 3-phase priority system
- **Session Logging**: Enhanced backup and recovery workflows established

## Conversation Highlights

### Key Decisions Made

#### 1. GitHub Issue Resolution Order
- **Foundation First**: Issues #26, #24, #18 for stable base
- **Integration Second**: Cross-script coordination issues #29, #22, #23
- **Complex Last**: High-risk issues #27, #28, #19 with mature foundation

#### 2. Strategic Approaches Selected
- **Issue #22**: Minimal attribute standardization approach (low risk, high impact)
- **Issue #23**: Simple 5-line regex enhancement (targeted fix)
- **Issue #18**: Targeted approach with expanded scope (archive 6 abbreviations, remove 3 compound regions)

#### 3. Workflow Optimization
- **Phase-based Organization**: Clear progression from foundation to complex issues
- **Dependency Management**: Issues resolved in order to prevent cascading problems
- **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive GitHub issue analysis with implementation guidance

### Important Discussions

#### Session Logging Strategy
- **Timestamp Consistency**: Established Pacific Time primary with UTC secondary
- **Context Preservation**: Complete todo state capture for session continuity
- **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive analysis and strategic planning documentation

#### Priority Management Philosophy
- **Risk Assessment**: Foundation issues resolved first to prevent blocking
- **Complexity Sequencing**: Simple fixes before complex refactoring
- **Impact Optimization**: Maximum value delivery through strategic ordering

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority (Next Session)
1. **Resolve Issue #26**: CRITICAL separator cleanup in Script 03 v4 report type reconstruction
2. **Test Issue #26 Fix**: Validate separator handling with comprehensive test cases
3. **Begin Issue #24**: Simple single-line date removal bug fix (quick win)

### Short-term Goals (Following Sessions)
