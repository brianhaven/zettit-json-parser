## Technical Context

### Dictionary Architecture Results
```python
# Primary Keywords (8 core terms - 96.7% Market boundary coverage)
PRIMARY_KEYWORDS = ['Market', 'Research', 'Report', 'Analysis', 'Study', 'Forecast', 'Outlook', 'Trends']

# Secondary Keywords (48 specialized terms)  
SECONDARY_KEYWORDS = ['Survey', 'Intelligence', 'Review', 'Assessment', 'Insights', ...]

# Separators and Punctuation
SEPARATORS = [',', ' - ', ' & ', ' | ']
BOUNDARY_MARKERS = ['(', ')', '[', ']', ':', '-']
```

### Code Changes
- **Script 03c**: New dictionary extraction script with comprehensive analysis capabilities
- **Documentation Updates**: README.md and experiments/README.md updated with v3 architecture
- **GitHub Issue Updates**: Issue #20 updated with refined approach and implementation plan

### Configuration Updates
- **Pattern Analysis**: 921 patterns successfully analyzed with complete dictionary extraction
- **Database Integration**: Dictionary results ready for MongoDB integration in v3 implementation
- **Performance Baseline**: 100% analysis success rate establishes performance expectations

## Conversation Highlights

### Key Decisions Made
- **Decision**: Complete dictionary extraction foundation before algorithm implementation
  - **Rationale**: Ensures comprehensive understanding of pattern structure before building detection algorithms
  - **Impact**: Provides complete foundation for v3 implementation with 96.7% Market boundary coverage

- **Decision**: Remove 'Global' from primary keywords dictionary  
  - **Rationale**: Preserves 'Global' for Script 04 geographic detection to avoid pipeline conflicts
  - **Impact**: Maintains clean separation between report type and geographic entity detection

- **Decision**: Phase-based implementation approach (foundation → algorithm → testing)
  - **Rationale**: Systematic approach ensures quality and completeness at each stage
  - **Impact**: Enables focused development with clear milestone validation

### Important Discussions
- **Dictionary Completeness**: Validated that extracted dictionaries cover all existing patterns comprehensively
- **Market Boundary Detection**: Confirmed 96.7% coverage with 'Market' as primary boundary marker
- **Edge Case Planning**: Identified strategies for handling acronyms, regions, and non-dictionary terms
- **Performance Expectations**: Established 100% analysis success as baseline for v3 implementation

## Next Actions

1. **Implement Market boundary detection algorithm (Task 3v3.6)** - Use primary keyword dictionary for boundary recognition
2. **Build sequential keyword ordering detection (Task 3v3.7)** - Detect keyword presence and order in titles  
3. **Add punctuation/separator detection (Task 3v3.8)** - Identify patterns between keyword boundaries
4. **Handle edge cases (Task 3v3.9)** - Process acronyms, regions, and non-dictionary terms
5. **Preserve market term preprocessing (Task 3v3.10)** - Integrate existing market term workflow
6. **Create comparison test harness (Task 3v3.11)** - Validate v3 against v2 performance
7. **Run comprehensive validation (Task 3v3.12)** - Ensure accuracy meets/exceeds current implementation
