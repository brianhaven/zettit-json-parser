### Blockers
None identified - all documentation and organizational tasks completed successfully.

## Technical Context

### Code Changes
- No code changes in this session
- All work focused on documentation synchronization and repository organization

### Configuration Updates
- Moved database maintenance scripts to proper utilities directory structure
- Created comprehensive README for database maintenance utilities

## Conversation Highlights

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Update Strategy** - Updated all relevant documentation files to reflect Script 03 v4 implementation status
2. **Database Utilities Organization** - Moved all database maintenance scripts to dedicated utilities directory with proper documentation
3. **Historical Context Preservation** - Ensured all moved scripts maintained their historical context and purpose documentation

### Important Discussions
- **Documentation Synchronization Priority** - Ensured all documentation accurately reflects current system state
- **Repository Organization Standards** - Applied consistent directory structure for utilities and maintenance scripts
- **Git Workflow Management** - Maintained clean commit history with descriptive messages

## Next Actions

### Immediate Priority
1. **Begin Phase 5 Topic Extractor Testing** - Create full pipeline test using Scripts 01→02→03v4→04→05
2. **Process Large-Scale Pipeline Testing** - Run 500-1000 titles through complete pipeline
3. **Quality Analysis** - Generate and analyze topic extraction results for manual review

### Medium-Term Goals
1. **Resolve Outstanding GitHub Issues** (#22, #23, #24) using debugger-specialist approach
2. **Validate v4 Implementation** - Confirm that Script 03 v4 dictionary approach resolves legacy issues
3. **Complete Phase 6 Integration** - Implement confidence tracking across complete pipeline

### Long-Term Objectives
1. **Production Deployment Preparation** - Finalize system for production readiness
2. **Performance Optimization** - Achieve >92% accuracy targets across all components
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Complete pattern library and success metrics documentation
