- **Files Changed:** 612 files with 553 insertions and 2 deletions
- **Directory Fixes:** Corrected 3 misnamed directories with timestamp suffixes to proper prefixes

#### 2. Technical Infrastructure Created
- **`experiments/utilities/output_directory_manager.py`:** Standardized directory creation utility for future scripts
- **`experiments/utilities/reorganize_outputs.py`:** Bulk reorganization tool with dry-run capability

### Git Activity

**Major Commit:**
```
6e7506d feat: Reorganize outputs directory to YYYY/MM/DD structure and create management utilities
```

**Repository State:**
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed successfully
- ✅ Clean working directory (only untracked session log file)
- ✅ No uncommitted changes remain

## Technical Deliverables

### 1. Output Directory Manager (`experiments/utilities/output_directory_manager.py`)

```python
def create_organized_output_directory(script_name: str) -> str:
    """Create timestamped output directory in organized YYYY/MM/DD structure."""
    
def create_output_file_header(script_name: str, description: str) -> str:
    """Create standardized file header with dual timestamps."""
```

**Features:**
- Auto-detection of project root from any script location
- Consistent Pacific Time timestamps with dual PDT/UTC headers
- Organized structure: `outputs/YYYY/MM/DD/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_script_name/`
- Legacy compatibility during transition period

### 2. Reorganization Tool (`experiments/utilities/reorganize_outputs.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- Bulk directory reorganization with dry-run mode
- Intelligent timestamp detection and correction
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Safety checks and validation

### 3. Script Pattern Scanner (`experiments/utilities/update_script_outputs_pattern.py`)

**Analysis Results:**
- **22 scripts identified** requiring updates to use organized structure
- **Priority classification:** Core pipeline (2), testing (5), legacy/utility (15)
- **Pattern detection:** Identifies old manual directory creation patterns

### 4. Documentation (`outputs/README.md`)

**Benefits Documented:**
- ✅ **IDE Navigation:** Hierarchical structure improves file browsing
- ✅ **Temporal Organization:** Easy to find outputs by date
- ✅ **Scalability:** Prevents flat directory performance issues
- ✅ **Maintenance:** Easier cleanup and archival management
