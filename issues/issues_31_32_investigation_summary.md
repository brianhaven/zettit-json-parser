# Git Issues #31 & #32 Investigation Summary

## Investigation Overview

**Date:** 2025-09-23
**Investigator:** Claude Code (Debugger Specialist Agent)
**Scope:** Analysis of Git Issues #31 (Acronym Loss) and #32 (Symbol Preservation Edge Cases)
**Approach:** Minimal-risk, simplicity-first solutions

## Executive Summary

Both issues represent quality enhancement opportunities rather than critical bugs. They affect a combined ~10% of edge cases while the core pipeline maintains excellent performance on standard business cases.

### Issue #31: Acronym Loss in Report Type Extraction
- **Impact:** 5-10% of titles lose acronyms (e.g., RTLS, AI, IoT)
- **Severity:** Medium - affects searchability and context
- **Root Cause:** Script 03 v4 removes ALL keywords in report type area, including topic-related acronyms
- **Solution:** Implement acronym detection and preservation logic
- **Effort:** ~6 hours
- **Risk:** Low - additive changes only

### Issue #32: Complex Symbol Sequence Preservation
- **Impact:** <5% of titles with complex symbols (&&, multiple symbols)
- **Severity:** Low - edge cases only
- **Root Cause:** Three independent regex cleanup passes conflict on complex sequences
- **Solution:** Unified symbol preservation system (deferred)
- **Effort:** ~7 hours
- **Risk:** Medium - could regress working cases
- **Priority:** LOW - defer to future enhancement cycle

## Detailed Findings

### Common Patterns
1. **Both issues occur in Script 03 v4** (report type extractor)
2. **Both involve content preservation** during systematic removal
3. **Both affect edge cases** more than standard business cases
4. **Both have clear, testable solutions**

### Pipeline Integration Points

#### Issue #31 - Acronym Loss Flow:
```
Title: "Real-Time Locating Systems Market Size, RTLS Industry Report, 2025"
   ↓
Script 02: Remove "2025"
   ↓
Script 03: Detect keywords ["Market", "Size", "RTLS", "Industry", "Report"]
           Remove ALL keywords → "Real-Time Locating Systems" (RTLS lost!)
   ↓
Script 05: Topic = "Real-Time Locating Systems" ❌ Missing acronym
```

#### Issue #32 - Symbol Edge Cases:
```
Title: "Technology && Software Market Analysis"
   ↓
Script 03: Pass 1 - Preserve "&&"
           Pass 2 - Reduce to "&"
           Pass 3 - Validate single "&"
   ↓
Result: "Technology & Software" ❌ One ampersand lost
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (Issue #31)
**Implement acronym preservation logic** in Script 03 v4:

1. **Add detection method** (~50 lines):
   - Detect acronyms before removal
   - Map acronyms to expanded forms
   - Track which acronyms relate to topics

2. **Modify cleanup logic** (~30 lines):
   - Check if removed content contains topic acronyms
   - Preserve or re-append relevant acronyms
   - Maintain existing functionality

3. **Add test coverage** (~20 lines):
   - Test standard acronym patterns
   - Verify no regressions
   - Validate preservation accuracy

**Implementation approach:**
```python
# Minimal change to _clean_remaining_title() method
def _clean_remaining_title_with_acronym_preservation(self, ...):
    # 1. Detect acronyms first (new)
    acronyms = self._detect_acronyms(original_title)

    # 2. Perform standard removal (existing)
    remaining = self._clean_remaining_title(...)

    # 3. Restore lost acronyms (new)
    for acronym, expanded in acronyms.items():
        if expanded in remaining and acronym not in remaining:
            remaining = f"{expanded} ({acronym})"

    return remaining
```

### Deferred Action (Issue #32)
**Do NOT implement now** - reasons:
1. Primary cases work perfectly (100% success)
2. Edge cases are rare (<5% of titles)
3. Risk of regression outweighs benefit
4. Higher priorities exist (Phase 5 topic extraction)

**Future approach when ready:**
- Create unified symbol preservation system
- Replace three separate cleanup passes
- Extensive testing required before deployment

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### For Issue #31 (Recommended for Implementation):
1. **Feature flag** for gradual rollout
2. **Preserve existing logic** - only add new functionality
3. **Comprehensive testing** before production
4. **Monitor metrics** post-deployment

### For Issue #32 (Deferred):
1. **Document current behavior** thoroughly
2. **Create test suite** for future implementation
3. **Wait for stable baseline** after other fixes
4. **Consider customer feedback** before prioritizing

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Issue #31 Test Cases:
```python
# Must pass after implementation
[
    ("Real-Time Locating Systems Market Size, RTLS Industry Report, 2025",
     "Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS)"),
    ("Artificial Intelligence Market, AI Technology Report, 2030",
     "Artificial Intelligence (AI)"),
    ("Internet of Things Market, IoT Industry Study, 2025",
     "Internet of Things (IoT)")
]
```

### Issue #32 Test Cases (for future):
```python
# Document for future implementation
[
    ("Technology && Software Market", "Technology && Software"),
    ("Data & Analytics + AI/ML Market", "Data & Analytics + AI/ML"),
    ("R&D/Innovation + Technology Market", "R&D/Innovation + Technology")
]
```

## Success Criteria

### Issue #31 Success Metrics:
- ✅ >95% acronym preservation rate
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests
- ✅ <5ms additional processing time
- ✅ Clear improvement in test cases

### Issue #32 Success Metrics (Future):
- ⏸️ 100% edge case resolution
- ⏸️ No impact on standard cases
- ⏸️ Simplified maintenance
- ⏸️ <10ms processing overhead

## Timeline & Priority

### Recommended Execution Order:
1. **NOW:** Implement Issue #31 fix (~6 hours)
2. **LATER:** Defer Issue #32 to post-Phase 5
3. **FOCUS:** Complete Phase 5 topic extraction
4. **OPTIMIZE:** Return to edge cases after core completion

## Files Impacted

### Primary Changes (Issue #31):
- `/experiments/03_report_type_extractor_v4.py` - Add acronym logic
- `/experiments/tests/test_03_acronym_preservation.py` - New test file

### Future Changes (Issue #32):
- `/experiments/03_report_type_extractor_v4.py` - Symbol system refactor
- `/experiments/tests/test_symbol_edge_cases.py` - Edge case tests

## Conclusion

**Issue #31** represents a valuable enhancement that should be implemented due to its:
- Clear business value (improved searchability)
- Low implementation risk (additive only)
- Straightforward solution approach
- Measurable success criteria

**Issue #32** should be deferred because:
- Edge cases are rare and non-critical
- Current solution works for 95%+ of cases
- Risk of regression exists
- Resources better spent on Phase 5

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this analysis with stakeholders
2. **Approve** Issue #31 implementation
3. **Defer** Issue #32 to backlog
4. **Implement** Issue #31 acronym preservation
5. **Test** thoroughly before deployment
6. **Monitor** results post-implementation
