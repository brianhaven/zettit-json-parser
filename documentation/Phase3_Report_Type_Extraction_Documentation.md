## Database Pattern Library Analysis

### Pattern Library Statistics
**Total Report Type Patterns:** 355 patterns across 5 format types

| Format Type | Count | Percentage | Avg Priority | Description |
|-------------|-------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| compound_type | 314 | 88.5% | 1.74 | Complex multi-word patterns |
| terminal_type | 17 | 4.8% | 4.24 | Single word at end of title |
| embedded_type | 10 | 2.8% | 3.30 | Patterns within title text |
| prefix_type | 8 | 2.3% | 2.38 | Patterns at beginning of title |
| acronym_embedded | 6 | 1.7% | - | Special acronym extraction patterns |

### Key Pattern Examples

#### Compound Type Patterns (88.5%)
Most common patterns including manual review discoveries:
- "Market Size & Share Report" 
- "Market Size, Share & Growth Report"
- "Market Size, Share, Industry Report"
- "Market Size, Share, Global Industry Report"
- "Market Analysis Terminal"
- "Global Industry Report"

#### Terminal Type Patterns (4.8%)
Simple end-of-title patterns:
- "Market Report Terminal" → Pattern: `\\bMarket\\s+(Report)\\s*$`
- "Analysis Terminal" → Pattern: `\\b(Analysis)\\s*$`
- "Study Terminal" → Pattern: `\\b(Study)\\s*$`
- "Research Terminal" → Pattern: `\\b(Research)\\s*$`
- "Outlook Terminal" → Pattern: `\\b(Outlook)\\s*$`

#### Acronym-Embedded Patterns (1.7%) - **CRITICAL RESOLUTION**
Special patterns for acronym extraction with pipeline preservation:
- "Market Size, [ACRONYM] Industry Report"
- "Market Size, Share, [ACRONYM] Industry Report"
- "Market Size & Share, [ACRONYM] Industry Report"
- "Market, [ACRONYM] Industry Report"

**GitHub Issue #11 Resolution Details:**
- **Root Cause:** Missing `ReportTypeFormat.ACRONYM_EMBEDDED` enum value
- **Control Flow Bug:** Duplicate match blocks preventing proper acronym returns
- **Pattern Priority Issue:** Compound patterns matching before acronym_embedded patterns
- **Complete Fix:** All enum, control flow, and priority issues resolved

## Market-Aware Processing Logic Implementation

### Dual Processing Architecture

#### Market Term Classifications
- **market_for**: "Market for X" patterns requiring extraction/rearrangement
- **market_in**: "Market in Y" patterns requiring extraction/rearrangement  
- **market_by**: "Market by Z" patterns requiring extraction/rearrangement
- **standard**: Direct pattern matching without rearrangement

### Processing Logic Examples

#### Market Term Processing Workflow
**Input:** "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market in Automotive Outlook & Trends"
1. **Extract "Market"** from "Market in" phrase
2. **Preserve "in Automotive"** for pipeline continuation
3. **Search remaining text** for report patterns (excluding "Market" prefix)
4. **Find "Outlook & Trends"** in database patterns
5. **Reconstruct:** "Market" + "Outlook & Trends" = **"Market Outlook & Trends"**
6. **Pipeline Forward:** "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Automotive"

#### Standard Processing Workflow  
**Input:** "APAC Personal Protective Equipment Market Analysis"
1. **Direct pattern matching** on complete title
2. **Find "Market Analysis"** in database patterns (complete match)
3. **No rearrangement needed**
4. **Pipeline Forward:** "APAC Personal Protective Equipment"

### Acronym-Embedded Processing (**Issue #11 Resolution**)

#### Example: "Directed Energy Weapons (DEW) Market Size, Industry Report"
**Processing Steps:**
1. **Detect acronym_embedded pattern:** "Market Size, [ACRONYM] Industry Report"
2. **Extract acronym:** "DEW" 
3. **Expand acronym:** "Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)"
4. **Return report type:** "Market Size, Industry Report"
5. **Pipeline forward:** "Directed Energy Weapons (DEW)"

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Added missing `ReportTypeFormat.ACRONYM_EMBEDDED` enum value
- ✅ Fixed control flow structure with proper indentation and logic
- ✅ Corrected pattern priority in both pattern_groups arrays (lines 330 & 472)
- ✅ Ensured acronym_embedded patterns match before compound patterns

## Database Quality Assurance
