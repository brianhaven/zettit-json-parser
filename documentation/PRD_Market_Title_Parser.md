# Market Research Title Parser - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The Market Research Title Parser is an AI-powered solution designed to extract structured information from market research report titles stored in MongoDB's `markets_raw` collection. The system will parse `report_title_short` values to identify topics, topic names, and geographical regions, then insert this structured data back into the database.

This solution addresses the limitations of previous static mapping approaches by implementing a dynamic, multi-tier extraction system that combines specialized NER models with small local LLMs for superior accuracy and flexibility.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
- **Static Lists**: Previous approach relied on extensive manual mappings (`region_mappings.json`, `market_terms.json`) that require constant maintenance
- **Limited Flexibility**: Hardcoded patterns fail with new variations and edge cases
- **Complex Scenarios**: Market research titles contain intricate patterns like "Market for Mining and Construction" where "Market" needs removal but "for" should be retained
- **Region Variations**: Geographic entities appear in numerous formats ("U.S.", "US", "USA", "United States") requiring normalization
- **Acronym Handling**: Technical terms like "(FLNG)" need special treatment for both topic and topicName fields

### Business Impact
- Manual effort required to maintain static mappings
- Inconsistent data extraction leading to poor categorization
- Inability to handle new market sectors and regions dynamically
- Reduced data quality affecting downstream analytics

## Solution Overview

### Cost-Optimized Multi-Tier Dynamic Extraction System

Based on extensive research, this solution prioritizes cost-effectiveness while maintaining high accuracy. The system is designed to run entirely on AWS EC2 t3.large instances (2vCPU, 8GB RAM) at ~$70-80/month, representing a 90% cost reduction compared to GPU-based approaches.

### Architecture Decision: Data-Driven NER-First Approach

**UPDATED BASED ON EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS (2025-08-19)**

Analysis of 19,558 actual market research titles confirms our NER-first approach with critical implementation insights:

- **Tier 1 NER models handle 99.6% of scenarios** (35.4% simple + 64.3% moderate + 0.36% complex)
- **Tier 2 LLM required for <0.1% of very complex cases** (4 titles out of 19,558)
- **Major challenge identified**: 15,971 false positive "geographic" entities requiring sophisticated filtering
- **Topic extraction complexity**: Current regex approaches achieve only ~20% quality, requiring NER-based enhancement

### CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS

**Dataset Characteristics (19,558 titles analyzed):**
- âœ… **99.9% contain "market"** - Validates market-term-based processing approach
- âœ… **12.4% contain geographic information** - ~2,423 titles with regional scope
- âœ… **87.6% are non-geographic** - Global/product-focused reports requiring empty regions output
- âœ… **Geographic distribution when present**: Europe (378), North America (365), Asia (255)
- âœ… **Regional acronym usage validated**: APAC (11), EMEA (11), MEA (15), ASEAN (15), GCC (18)

**Processing Complexity Distribution:**
- **Simple (35.4%)**: Basic patterns - Regex rules sufficient
- **Moderate (64.3%)**: Standard complexity - NER models primary processing path
- **Complex (0.36%)**: Multiple regions/conjunctions - NER + advanced rules
- **Very Complex (0.02%)**: Only 4 titles - LLM fallback minimal cost impact

**Topic Extraction Quality Crisis Identified:**
- ðŸš¨ **Current regex approach fails**: Extracts "2030", "Industry Report", "Share" as topics
- ðŸš¨ **Success rate**: Only ~20% meaningful topic extractions with suffix removal
- âœ… **Solution confirmed**: NER-based entity detection + contextual parsing required

**Business Domain Intelligence:**
