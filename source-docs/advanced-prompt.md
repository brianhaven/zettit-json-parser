Let me try to provide some additional guidance that might help refine things. Consider these steps in this order of processing and analysis (with examples):

**STEP 1**
Example 1: "Oman Industrial Salts Market For Oil & Gas Industry Report, 2020-2027"
- In complex cases like this, we could first detect for the "market_terms" that I tried detecting in the example script.
- Look for the market terms that divide a potential topic. If the term "Market in" or "Market for" appear in the title, then this is a special case where the report type ("Industry Report") and year range ("2020-2027") would be identified.
- In cases like this, most of the titles will end with a report type like "Industry Report", "Market Report", etc., as well as a date range in years like "2020-2027".
- We can first look for date ranges at the end of the titles.
- Then look for report types wither immediately preceding the date range, or just at the end of the title.
- Analyze for a comprehensive list of these patters to build a reference guide for further analysis.



**STEP 2**
Example 2: "APAC & Middle East Personal Protective Equipment Market Report, 2030"
- In simpler examples like this one, if there isn't a "market_term" ("Market in" or "Market for"), we can either extract the year range at the end (if present) as a distinct values and store it, and then detect the report type as a dinsticnt value and store it, and then assume everytging after the word "Market" (in this particuar example) would be excluded from any topic or region definition.
- Iassuming we start with the end of the titles lke this, we can then assume that we know the topic is somehere in the text that is left after we exclude the report type and date range.

Perhaps we start the script analysis with this approach to analyze the end of the title to further isolate the topic.

**STEP 3**
In a case like Example 1 where the curently defined "marlet_terms" are present (assuming this is the first analysis we perform on the title), we can set these asside for a different analysis. Since we know a "market_term" present is likely separating the desired topic, then we just look for know patterns of the report type and possibly date range at the end and parse those out as two separate items and then we know  what remains include the topic, possible region, and a possible additional parsing step to deal with the "market_term" removal but retain the separation work in the "Market_term" (e.g., "for" or "in").
- In example 1 above ("Oman Industrial Salts Market For Oil & Gas Industry Report, 2020-2027"):
	- We detected that this is a title with a "market_term" for special handling.
	- Based on the initial pattern analysis, we know the next step is to identify if a date range exists at the end of the title, and if so, extract it and store it. Also exclude it from the analysis of the remaining text of the title.
	- Now we know the next step is to use our pattern analysis to look for common report types. in this example, "Industry Report" and we extract and store that as a value. We also exclude it from the remaining text for further analysis.
	- Now what we have left is "Oman Industrial Salts Market For Oil & Gas" to analyze. Since, in this scenario (a "market_term" title), we can remove "Market" as identified from the "market_term" but leave the sepraration word **if** there is still text remaining after the separation word. If there is no text remaining after the separation word, then we can simply exclude the full "market_term" and just work with what's left.
	- Now, in this scenario with this example, what's left is "Oman Industrial Salts For Oil & Gas".
	- From here, we can potentially try to identify if a region term exists. We may be able to temporarily create out own comprehensive lists to identify them without the sPacy or GLiNER models for this research script experiment. If that works, then we may have deteced "Oman" and we can extract that and add it to the "regions" array. Then what's left is the topicName,  "Industrial Salts Market For Oil & Gas".

**STEP 4**
Now for scenarios like example 2 above, "APAC & Middle East Personal Protective Equipment Market Report, 2030", we can process this similarly, but without the "market_term" requirement. This process would be:
- Search for a date range at the end of the title, if present. in this example "2030". Notice this is not a range but a single year. I think the key here is that we're looking for either a date (year) or date range (in years) and that's what we extract and store.
- With "2030" now gone, the tex that remains is "APAC & Middle East Personal Protective Equipment Market Report". NExt we can look for common report types and detect, extract, store, and exclude "Market Report" whcih now leaves us with "APAC & Middle East Personal Protective Equipment" for analysis.
- Next we can attempt a region identification and extraction. If possible, we can detect two regions in this title, "APAC" and "Middle East" (in this case separate with an "&" ampersand). If we extract and add those two to the regions array, we're left with "Personal Protective Equipment" which is our topicName.

If we use the steps above as a guide we can create a new script that does the following to identify patterns:
1. Searches for patterns and instances of "market_terms". Right now, we alredy have two define so we're mostly trying to identify which titles fall in the "with market_terms category" or "without market_terms" category.
2. Analyze titles to try and identify and create rules for detecting dates/date-ranges. Store a list of those or create a simple function to find them.
3. Analyze titles for report types and create a list of those for future reference.

Once we build some lists, then we can try to analyze (and in the future process) titles using the steps above. I think these initial pattern identification processes followed by the steps above, we can potentially analyze the majority of titles. We will probably need to analyze the lists of terms (both by you and me) to evaluate and make corrections based on what we find to refine the script until we have a comprehensive pattern matching algorithm that can be used for the final script for the application. 

Do you understand my logic and reasoning for the order of operations? Do you think this would help you create a new script that can process the database entries, learn from them, create some initial reference lsits, re-analyze the database entries and output summaries and analysis that will help you build a final scritp later that will be the official topcic and region parser.

Please share your thinking, additional ideas, and approach to implementing this in a brand new script. Share this with me for my review before taking an actions so I can review and approve.
